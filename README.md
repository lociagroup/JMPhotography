  Jessica was awesome, she made me feel very comfortable despite my naturally, awkward demeanor when it comes to pictures lol. Her ideas and angles were very creative and they came out beautiful! Also, it was freezing the day of, and she made sure I had her jacket on in between pictures, (lol) which just shows her kind-hearted personality. <3

## Baby/Maternity – (Intro)
>Having a baby is a HUGE chapter of everyone’s life. It’s a chapter in which you do not want to miss even one second!  We absolutely adore babies at JMphotography and want to make sure to capture the precious journey of your little one.  Whether mommies prefer an outdoor shoot or the ease within their home, our main priority is comfort. We suggest having your Maternity photo shoot between 7-8 months. The belly is at its best shape at this point.  Shooting after 8 months is not only risky but mommies may have a little bit more water retention and may feel a little less comfortable.  
For Newborn photography we urge parents to come in early. Full term babies can come in as early as 10 days. They are easier to position and a lot easier to photograph within the first 3 weeks of birth.  We will schedule at a time that is most convenient to accommodate feeding and nap times.

# Engagement/Couple
>Love is in the air!! Let me just say I LOVE shooting love!  Love is a beautiful thing and whether it’s an engagement, save the date, anniversary, elopement, valentines or just feeling like love birds, JMphotography is the perfect photographer to call.  My goal is to capture the love, the emotion and intimacy that naturally lie between the two of you.
Side note:  A lot of couples may ask what to wear. I believe this choice is entirely up to you, but a few suggestions of mine will be that you choose something to match your personality and something you will feel comfortable and confident in (Confidence is key!). In my opinion pastel colors, which are complimenting with your partners wardrobe, look great.  You may also want to keep the weather/season in mind.

# Family/Pets
I believe the single best thing that God has given us in life is our Family … and yes I include our pets! There is nothing more beautiful than capturing the chemistry between family members. My goal is to photograph you from afar during your family’s most natural state to capture this true chemistry.
Side note: Several clients will ask what to wear. I believe this choice is entirely up to you, but a few suggestions of mine will be that you choose something to match your family’s  personality and something you will all feel comfortable and confident in (Confidence is key!).  In my opinion pastel colors, which are complimenting with your partners wardrobe, look great.  You may also want to keep the weather/season in mind.
