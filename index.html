						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>Hi! I’m super excited that you’re reading this right now because that means you have
							interest in the person behind the lens, which is super important! Excellent photos are
							taken when there is a comfortable and natural atmosphere and this is exactly what I aim
							for as your photographer. I like to get to know a little about my clients and build a
							connection so I can capture your exact photography needs.
							The name given to me was Jessica Montes, but I go by Jess or Montes… or whatever you
							would like me to go by! I was born a northerner from New Jersey but grown a Florida
							girl! I’m a nature enthusiast, adventure seeker, musician, photographer and artist. I
							graduated from the University of Central Florida in 2014 and currently working at a
							children’s hospital in central Florida. My passion in art and photography has been there
							ever since I remember but the drive and motivation began when I purchased my first
							DSLR in 2010. I’ve been photographing ever since. I have experience in pretty much
							everything but I specialize in family and children. If there is anything else you would like
							to know about me feel free to contact me!</p>

						<h2>Baby/Maternity</h2>
						<p>Having a baby is a HUGE chapter of everyone’s life. It’s a chapter in
							which you do not want to miss even one second! We absolutely adore babies at JMphotography and
							want to make sure to capture the precious journey of your little one. Whether mommies prefer an
							outdoor shoot or the ease within their home, our main priority is comfort. We suggest having your
							Maternity photo shoot between 7-8 months. The belly is at its best shape at this point. Shooting after 8
							months is not only risky but mommies may have a little bit more water retention and may feel a little
							less comfortable.</p><p>For Newborn photography we urge parents to come in early. Full term babies can come in as early as 10
							days. They are easier to position and a lot easier to photograph within the first 3 weeks of birth. We will
							schedule at a time that is most convenient to accommodate feeding and nap times.</p>

						<h2>Engagement/Couple</h2>
						<p>Love is in the air!! Let me just say I LOVE shooting love! Love is a beautiful
							thing and whether it’s an engagement, save the date, anniversary, elopement, valentines or just feeling
							like love birds, JMphotography is the perfect photographer to call. My goal is to capture the love, the
							emotion and intimacy that naturally lie between the two of you.</p>
							<blockquote> <h4>Side note:</h4>A lot of couples may ask what to wear. I believe this choice is entirely up to you, but a few
							suggestions of mine will be that you choose something to match your personality and something you
							will feel comfortable and confident in (Confidence is key!). In my opinion pastel colors, which are
							complimenting with your partners wardrobe, look great. You may also want to keep the
							weather/season in mind.
